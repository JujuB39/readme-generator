  ## Description
  This weeks assignment was to create an application that produces and professional Readme. The application will take the user through a series of questions that are included in most Readme files. Once the user has answered all the question the responses the user gave will be written into the actual Readme file using writeToFile. 
  ## Installation
  In order to use this application the user must install node.js as well as inquirer. The user should use node v16 instead of v18. Lastly when installing inquirer make sure to do npm i inquirer 8.2.4. 
  ## Usage
  This project allows a user to generate a readme. It takes you through all the information that is included in a general readme and prompt the user questions so that it can generate a readme that meets the basic requirement of filling one out. The user will only have to give information on their project and this code will write and setup the readme for the user.

  ## Test
  In order to test this project, all you have to do is run node index.js. Once this is done it will prompt you to answer serveral questions. Once you finish answering all the questions the user should be able to open up the readme and see their responses generated into the readme in their corresponding sections.
